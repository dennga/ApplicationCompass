# Application Compass

## Project Overview
This is a command-line interface (CLI) tool developed in Java. Its primary purpose is to simplify and manage the job application process, allowing users to efficiently track their applications and maintain an organized overview of their job search.

## Functions (Features)
* **Job Application Tracking:** Users can add new job application records, view a comprehensive list of all applications, and modify or delete existing entries.
* **Status Management:** Each application includes a customizable status field (e.g., "Applied", "Interview Scheduled", "Rejected", "Offer Received") to reflect the current stage of the process.
* **Basic Data Persistence:** Application data will be saved to and loaded from a local file (e.g., a CSV file) to ensure information is retained between sessions.
